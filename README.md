# Hylo.Social

The project is about smart business cards leveraging on NFC technology, it has been around for quite sometime with names like Tappy, Mobilo, Linq, Wave, mTap and local ones is OneGoodCard. We are recreating the web-app and the backend services. We have not solidify our plans on what tech stacks we are planning to use so keep a look out!

This is a collab project with [@DemonDia](https://github.com/DemonDia) and myself! This project will be a full-stack application and tentatively hosting it on AWS. It will most likely be deployed on the domain [Hylo.Social](http://hylo.social). No concrete plans on how we want to test this project out, it could be physically printing nfc cards, giving out to 5 random people and interview them to conclude this project. We also might be doing a video to breakdown the interviews, technical challenges, and maybe the cost of the entire project.
